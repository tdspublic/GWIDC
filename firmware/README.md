# Firmware

This directory contains the ESP8266/NodeMCU firmware for the
GWIDC (General-purpose WiFi-connected Indicator DeviCe).

- Entry point: `src/main.ino`

## Building with Arduino IDE

1. Install the **ESP8266** core via the Boards Manager.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed
    - string.h
    - Preferences.h
    - ESP8266WiFi.h
    - WiFiClient.h
    - DNSServer.h
    - WiFiManager.h
    - ESP8266HTTPClient.h
    - ESP8266WebServer.h
    - ArduinoOTA.h
    - ArduinoJson.h
    - Adafruit_NeoPixel.h
4. Copy the sketch `src/main.ino` into the Arduino IDE editor.
5. Select the correct ESP8266 board and upload.

Though the initial software upload must be done via NodeMCU serial port, the GWIDC does have an Over-the-Air (OTA) update capability. Once the GWIDC is connected to a WiFi network, new software releases can be uploaded over WiFi using the Arduino IDE.
